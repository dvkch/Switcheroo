# Switcheroo

Quick and dirty native macOS app that will check a website's `sitemap.xml` against a new domain.

When you're developing your new website and want to check if all your previously accessible pages will be availble on your new one, this is the way to go!

## Features

Currently supported features:

- importing a sitemap file, which you can generate at <http://www.xml-sitemaps.com> for instance
- cleanup the imported file
- enter your new website's temporary domain
- check the status of all page paths
- export the status for each path as a CSV file
- show redirections
- double click on a line to open the tested URL

Planned features, if time permits:

- localize the app in FR and EN
- automatic updates

## Disclaimer

This is a quickly developed project, as all my projects they are mainly to help me in my day to day tasks and made not be easily usable or extendable by other people. They also may not receive a lot of updates, if they do at all. 

You're free to fork or send PRs for improvements. If you encounter any bug, do report an issue, ideally with a reproducible example, I'll get on it when I can find the time.
